Place_1982_2020.gif shows the changes in Place Glacier extent and thickness from 1982 to 2020 simulated by coupling a surface mass balance model (SnowModel: Liston and Elder, 2006) with an ice dynamics model (Clarke et al. 2015). This is part of my current postdoctoral work (Mukherjee et al. 2021, under preparation). The simulation is created by me.

Peyto_Snowcover.gif uses PlanetScope data and shows how the snowcover on Peyto Glacier change with the day/date of the year 2018 and also plots the day of year vs. average surface reflectance of the glacier. Then I fit a smooth curve through those points using localised linear regression (loess) to identify the date on which the surface reflectance is minimum and extract the value of the minimum surface reflectance for Peyto Glacier. This surface reflectance is treated as a surfae mass balance metric for the year 2018 for Peyto Glacier. This is also part of my current postdoctoral work (Mukherjee et al. 2021, under preparation). The simulation was first propposed and created by my co-author J. Shea, which I later updated and finalized.
